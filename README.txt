# Milestone-3
# 1) Investigations The Game
# 2) In order to start the game you the player would open maingame.py and hit the run button and then input your name where it prompts you to and from here you are prompt with options that you will have to pick which you would like to do first and the same goes on for the other chapters.
# 3) The visual play for the game have been uploaded as screenshot 1, 2, 3.
# 4) The game is all finished for right now and will have a part 2 sometime in the near future. The first improvement I would make a is in Chapter 1 to prompt the user with a message that won't allow them to just leave the house without getting dressed and doing hygiene and the second improvement would be giving the player options on what they would want to bring with them.
